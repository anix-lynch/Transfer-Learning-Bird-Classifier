## 🚀 Transfer Learning and Superconvergence

In this project, we’ll help **Sam**, a photographer, organize 10,000 images of 10 rare bird species by building a **bird classifier**. To achieve this, we’ll use **transfer learning** with a pretrained ResNet model and apply **superconvergence** techniques like learning rate finders and the OneCycle policy. Let’s dive into the world of **PyTorch** and build an efficient classifier! 🦜📸

## Project Overview

The project focuses on developing a deep learning-based image classifier for bird species, using **transfer learning** and **superconvergence** for faster and more effective training. We’ll modify the **ResNet-18** architecture to classify images of birds, ensuring efficient convergence with cutting-edge techniques like the **LR finder** and **OneCycle policy**.
